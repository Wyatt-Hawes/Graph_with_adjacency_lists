Graph and FindPath
==============

FindPath
---------
> usage "FindPath <input> <output>" finds the shortest path between the input file nodes
> There must be the format as the first line being the total vertices
> The next set of lines must be in the form "# #" where the first number is the start of the connection between vertices
> and the second being the end of the connection
> End this part of the input with a "0 0"
> Then list the two nodes in the same way with the fastest path between those two nodes.

Graph
---------
> A graph data structure that allows you to add nodes and find paths between those nodes
